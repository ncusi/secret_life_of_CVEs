# The Secret Life of CVEs - code and notebooks

This repository contains scripts to process and join data from the
World of Code dataset (see <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16196>) and
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) dataset 
(gathered using the [cve-search](https://www.cve-search.org/) project),
that were used in the _"The Secret Life of CVEs"_ paper submission,
accepted to MSR 2023 Challenge: <https://conf.researchr.org/track/msr-2023/msr-2023-mining-challenge>.

Results were analyzed with the help of Jupyter Notebooks,
available in the 'notebooks/' subdirectory.

The final dataset, along with the source code and notebooks
used to extract and analyze the data, are accessible on Figshare:
<https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22007003>.
